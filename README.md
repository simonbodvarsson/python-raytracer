![current output](./img.png?raw=true "Output")

## Objective:
Write a simple ray tracer in Python which can be improved and expanded upon.

**Initial goal**:
- Get a simple raytracer to work and output static images of spheres, boxes etc.

**Possible stretch goals**:
- Add DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling)
- Add compilation to CUDA (e.g. via Numba) to speed up and learn some CUDA.
- Add UI to view output
- Add input config to UI
- Real time rendering: View the result as it is being built.
- Allow for adjusting viewpoint in real time.
- File parser: Support importing files with more complicated objects
- Support different textures: Glossy, matte etc.
- View in browser as a web-app
- Planet/Terrain procedural generation
